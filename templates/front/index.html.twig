            <h2 class="h1">A new approach to web development</h2>
            <p>Instead of building your next project based on a heavy CMS, that provides thousands of functions, modules
                and themes, you just create a new application using your favourite technology stack and just consume the unite cms GraphQL API.</p>

            <h3><i data-feather="chevron-right"></i> 100% decoupled - 100% flexible</h3>
            <p class="intend-left">The heart of unite cms is a GraphQL API, that allows developers to access all content
                in an easy and fast way</p>

            <h2 class="h1">Designed for content editors</h2>
            <p class="intend-left">For most content editors, dealing with a CMS is a lot of pain. Many CMS are based
                on different plugins, that not always play nicely together. Also, in many projects technical features
                are the main focus, the look and feel of the administration area has no high priority.</p>

            <h3><i data-feather="chevron-right"></i> unified and carefully crafted UI</h3>
            <p class="intend-left">unite cms administration interface provides an clean and unified user experience,
                that was specifically build for content editors.</p>

            <h3><i data-feather="chevron-right"></i> A tool for creative professionals</h3>
            <p class="intend-left">unite cms is not a website builder, where you can customize your website design,
                because this is the designer's job. You will also be not able to just download a plugin to extend the
                functionality of your website, because this is the developer's job.</p>
