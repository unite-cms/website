            <p>Instead of building your next project based on a heavy CMS, just create a new application using your favorite technology stack and consume the unite cms content API.</p>

            <h3><i class="color-icon purple" data-feather="radio"></i> 100% decoupled â€“ 100% flexible</h3>

            <h2 class="h1">Designed for content editors</h2>
            <p class="intend-left">For most content editors, dealing with a CMS is a lot of pain. Many CMS are based
                on plugins, that not always play nicely together and also technical features
                are often the project's main focus. We created the unite cms administration interface as a tool for content editors and not developers.</p>

            <h3><i class="color-icon purple" data-feather="edit-2"></i> unified and carefully crafted UI</h3>
            <p class="intend-left">The unite cms administration interface provides a clean and unified user experience,
                that is specifically build for content editors.</p>

            <h3><i class="color-icon red" data-feather="star"></i> A tool for creative professionals</h3>
            <p class="intend-left">unite cms is not a website builder, where you can customize your website design.
                This is the designer's job. Also, you will not be able to download a plugin to extend the
                functionality of your website. This is the developer's job. Instead, unite cms focuses 100% on providing
                the best content management experience.</p>
